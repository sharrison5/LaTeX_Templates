% Style guide for macros
%  Prefer \newcommand* and \newenvironment* over the unstarred versions when
% possible. This gives better error checking etc. when the arguments cannot
% contain blank lines or \par (which is often the case. See:
%  + https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/1057
%  + https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/86451
%   An issue is that whitespace in macros may cause unwanted spaces to be
% output in the text. This is what the trailing spaces are meant to prevent.
% Note that while these are often gobbled up by control words (e.g. \LaTeX),
% the policy is to err on the side of caution. Note that for e.g. options, we
% don't need to worry.
%   The policy for brace indentation is similar to e.g. C[++]

\iffalse
