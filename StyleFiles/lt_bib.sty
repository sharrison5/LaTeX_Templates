% General comments:
%  + Prefer a more verbose citestyle as, IMHO, it makes it easier to identify
%    specific references in the text.
%  + Makes sense to make use of \autocite{}, with \textcite{} where needed.
%  + The sort order for the bibliography itself (not the in-text citations) is
%    set using a second ref context. Use:
%    \newrefcontext[sorting=nyt]
%    \printbibliography
%  + Can add e.g. "In press" articles to bibliography using the pubstate field
%    pubstate = {inpress}
