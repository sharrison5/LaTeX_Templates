% Useful link commands {{{

\RequirePackage{hyphenat} %Defines command \nohyphens{text}

% Define a command that makes the whole of 'figure 6' a link, not just the number
% Stop hyphenation as if these get split over pages it fucks everything up
% Takes two command, e.g. \Ref{figure}{label}
\newcommand*{\Ref}[2]{\nohyphens{\hyperref[#2]{#1~\ref*{#2}}}}

% This creates a link to a subfigure e.g. 'Panel (b)'
\newcommand*{\SubRef}[2]{\nohyphens{\hyperref[#2]{#1~\subref{#2}}}}

% Makes URLs have same size and font as surrounding text
% \urlstyle{same}

% Command to print URL without http://
% e.g. \rurl{arma.sourceforge.net}
% http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/139934
\newcommand\hiddenurl[2]{%
    \href{#1#2}{\nolinkurl{#2}}%
}

    \hiddenurl{http://}{#1}%
