% Useful link commands {{{

% Define a command that makes the whole of 'Figure 6' a link, not just the
% number e.g. \Ref{Figure}{fig:label}. Similar to \autoref{fig:label}.

% Stop hyphenation as if these get split over pages it breaks everything
\RequirePackage{hyphenat}   % Defines command \nohyphens{text}

% Figure \ref{fig:label} --> \Ref{Figure}{fig:label}
\renewcommand*{\Ref}[2]{\nohyphens{\hyperref[#2]{#1~\ref*{#2}}}}

% Panel \subref{subfig:label} --> \SubRef{Panel}{subfig:label}
\newcommand*{\SubRef}[2]{\nohyphens{\hyperref[#2]{#1~\subref*{#2}}}}


% Command to print shortened URLs
% e.g. \rurl{arma.sourceforge.net}
% http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/139934
% \hiddenurl{https://}{ctan.org}{/pkg/hyperref} will print ctan.org
\newcommand*{\hiddenurl}[3]{%
    \href{#1#2#3}{\nolinkurl{#2}}%
}
% And versions that add http[s]://
\newcommand*{\hurl}[1]{%
    \hiddenurl{http://}{#1}{}%
}
\newcommand*{\hsurl}[1]{%
    \hiddenurl{https://}{#1}{}%
