% Notes {{{

% ## Sizing

% LaTeX gives us access to a variety of useful widths:
%  + \paperwidth \textwidth \columnwidth \linewidth

% Of these, \linewidth is the most adaptive in that it reflects e.g. the local
% environment. As such, it makes sense to specify floats relative to \linewidth
% as these will naturally adapt to one/two columns, minipages etc.

% See e.g.
% https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Lengths#LaTeX_default_lengths
% https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/16956

% Note also that we can use the \the command to inspect widths etc
% See e.g. https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/38680
%\the\textwidth\ \the\columnwidth\ \the\linewidth
